The task is to build a model that will determine the tone (neutral, positive, negative, Can’t 
tell) of the text. To do this, you will need to train the model on the training data. The resulting 
model will have to determine the class (neutral, positive, negative, Can’t tell) of test texts 
(test data that were not used to build the model) with maximum accuracy.
